<h2> Welcome </h2>

<h3> 
  This is the free "TV Guide" for Online RollPlay(RP or RPG) / TableTopRollPlayGames (TTRPG): "RND|Roll".
  <br><br>
  The main purpose is to list upcoming events from content creators of these games and offer some information on the event and even the character in the event.
  <br>
  This way, like with a TV Guide, one can browse through the listed events and can  decide which event to watch.
  <br><br>
  "RND|Roll" offers a number of features to vistiors, authenticated users and game masters.
  <br>
  You will have different ways to search for an event and be able to open every event for more details.
  <br> 
  Once you registered, you can create Events to be displayed. If want more than just watch, you can create a character to join an event. You can also create a profile to tell interesed people a little bit about you.
  <br>
  All your created events and characters will be attached to your profile. So when someone enjoys your events or your characters, they can see in what other events you played.
  <br><br>
  The "RND|Roll"-Team wishes all of you teh best and hope that you will have fun on our blog /  "TTRPG -TV Guide".
